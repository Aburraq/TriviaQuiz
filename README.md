# Trivia Quiz Game

## Description
This repository contains two distinct packages within the same Java project, each implementing a different approach to a trivia quiz game.

### Package 1: TriviaQuiz
The first package implements the trivia game using ArrayLists, arrays, and collections. It manages questions, answers, and user responses within these data structures. This version utilizes in-memory data handling for the game logic.

### Package 2: TriviaFileReader
The second package follows an alternate approach. It obtains questions from a file and employs a StringBuffer for efficient question handling. This version checks the player's answer against an answer key obtained from the file.

## Features of Each Package
### Package 1
- Utilizes ArrayLists, arrays, and collections for data handling
- Manages questions and answers within these data structures
- Implements game logic using in-memory data management

### Package 2
- Retrieves questions from a file for improved scalability
- Utilizes StringBuffer for efficient question handling
- Compares player answers with an answer key obtained from the file

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/trivia-quiz-game.git
2. Revise file source name according to your computer and optionally questions(I know they are little lame).

## Usage
- Both packages exist within the same project and can be accessed separately.
- Follow the specific instructions within each package's directory to run the respective game.

## File Structure
- `TriviaQuiz`: Contains the code for the first package.
- `TriviaFileReader`: Contains the code for the second package.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance either package are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.

## Acknowledgements
- Both packages are different implementations of the trivia quiz game within the same project.
- Each package offers a unique approach to handling game logic and question management.
